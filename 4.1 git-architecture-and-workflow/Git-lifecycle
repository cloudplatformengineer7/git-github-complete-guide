## 🔄 Git File Lifecycle

Every file in Git goes through **four** states:

1. Untracked – New file, Git doesn’t track it yet  
2. Staged – Changes added with git add, ready for commit  
3. Committed – Changes saved permanently in the local repository  
4. Modified – Tracked file changed but not yet staged
