### What are git stages?

There are 3 stages in git which is 
1. Working directory
2. Staging area
3. Repository

Working directory: in this stage, we can create a files for our project

Staging area: Nothing but a rough draft space
We can modify file in its current version to go into your next commit
We can track file in staging area

Repository: It is nothing but our project folder, when we commit the files it will store on repository.
The data is safely stored in your local database/.

We have 3 types of repositories
  1. Local
  2. Remote
  3. Central
