Why Git?

Before Git, software development teams struggled with:

- Manual code backups
- Code overwrites when multiple people edited    files
- No proper change history
- Poor team collaboration

📌 Result: High risk of losing code and slow development.

Git is the backbone of modern software development

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track, manage, and collaborate on code efficiently.

Git solves these problems by providing:

- Version tracking – Every change is recorded
- Collaboration – Multiple developers can work   simultaneously
- Rollback capability – Restore any previous     version instantly
- Complete history – Know who changed what and   why

Real-World Example

A team of 5 developers works on the same application:

- Each developer creates their own branch
- Changes are developed independently
- Git merges changes safely without overwriting others
- Conflicts are detected early and resolved cleanly

📌 Result: Faster development with zero code loss.

Why GitHub?

Git works locally on your system.
But real-world teams need remote collaboration and visibility.

That’s where GitHub comes in.

GitHub enhances Git by providing:

- Centralized remote repositories
- Code reviews via Pull Requests
- Issue & bug tracking
- CI/CD pipeline integrations
- Team access control & security

---

Industry Perspective

- Git is used by developers
- GitHub is used by teams & organizations

---

Simple Analogy

- 🧠 Git = Brain that remembers every change
- 🌍 GitHub = Cloud platform where teams collaborate

---

Summary

📌 Git = Version Control System
📌 GitHub = Collaboration & DevOps Platform

Together, they power modern DevOps, CI/CD, and agile development.
