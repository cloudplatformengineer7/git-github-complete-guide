Feature Branch Strategy

What It Is

Each new feature or task is developed in a separate branch.

Branch Structure

- "main" → stable production-ready code
- "feature/<feature-name>" → feature development

Example

git checkout -b feature-login

After development:

git checkout main
git merge feature-login

When to Use

✔ Small to medium teams
✔ Feature-based development
✔ Most common strategy

📌 Keeps "main" branch clean and stable.
