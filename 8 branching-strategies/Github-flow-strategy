GitHub Flow Strategy:

What It Is

A simpler strategy focused on continuous deployment.

Branch Structure

"main" → always deployable
Short-lived feature branches
Example

git checkout -b feature-search

Open a Pull Request → Review → Merge to "main".

When to Use

✔ SaaS products ✔ CI/CD pipelines ✔ Fast deployments

📌 Simple, clean, and modern.
