Trunk-Based Development:

What It Is

All developers work on a single main branch ("main" or "trunk") with very short-lived branches.

Key Rules

Frequent commits
Small changes
Strong automated testing
Example

git checkout -b small-fix git commit -m "Fix validation issue" git merge main

When to Use

✔ High DevOps maturity ✔ Strong CI/CD ✔ Microservices

📌 Encourages rapid delivery.
