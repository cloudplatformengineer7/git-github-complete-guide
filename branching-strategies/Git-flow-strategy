Git Flow Strategy:

What It Is

A structured branching model designed for scheduled releases.

Branches Used

"main" → production code
"develop" → integration branch
"feature/*" → new features
"release/*" → release preparation
"hotfix/*" → urgent production fixes
Example Workflow

git checkout -b feature-payment develop

After feature completion:

git checkout develop git merge feature-payment

Release preparation:

git checkout -b release/v1.0 develop

When to Use

✔ Large teams ✔ Multiple releases ✔ Enterprise applications

⚠️ Slightly complex to manage.
