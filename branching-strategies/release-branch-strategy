Release Branch Strategy:

What It Is

Separate branches are created specifically for releases.

Branch Structure

"main" → production
"release/v1.1" → release stabilization
Example

git checkout -b release/v1.1 main

Bug fixes applied only to release branch.

When to Use

✔ Long-running support versions ✔ Multiple active releases
