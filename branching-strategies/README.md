Git Branching Strategies

Branching strategies define how teams create, use, and merge branches in a Git repository.
Choosing the right strategy improves collaboration, release stability, and code quality.

1. Why Branching Strategies Matter

Without a strategy:

- Developers overwrite each other’s work
- Releases become risky
- Bugs reach production easily

With a strategy:

- Work is isolated and organized
- Releases are predictable
- Collaboration scales smoothly

📌 Branching strategies bring discipline to Git workflows.


2. Choosing the Right Strategy

- Small teams → Feature Branch / GitHub Flow
- Large teams → Git Flow
- CI/CD focused → GitHub Flow / Trunk-Based
- Multiple releases → Release Branch Strategy

Summary

- Branching strategies define how teams collaborate
- No single strategy fits all teams
- Choose based on team size, release model, and CI/CD maturity

📌 A good branching strategy is key to scalable and stable software development.
