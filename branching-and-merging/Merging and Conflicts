Merging Branches

Merging combines changes from one branch into another.

Basic Merge

First, switch to the target branch:

git checkout main

Merge the feature branch:

git merge feature-login

📌 This brings all changes from feature-login into main.

Merge Conflicts
   
A merge conflict occurs when:
The same file is modified in both branches
Git cannot decide which change to keep

Resolving Conflicts

Open the conflicted file
Choose the correct changes
Remove conflict markers
Commit the resolved changes

git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
