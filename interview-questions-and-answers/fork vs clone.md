### Fork vs Clone

🔹 Fork

A fork creates a new copy of someone else’s repository in your own GitHub account.

Real-time example:
You want to contribute to an open-source project (e.g., Kubernetes).
You fork the repository, make changes in your own GitHub repo, then raise a Pull Request.

📌 Used when you don’t have write access to the original repository.

🔹 Clone

A clone creates a local copy of a repository on your machine.

Real-time example:
Your team lead asks you to work on a feature.
You clone the team’s repository to your laptop, write code, commit, and push changes.

📌 Used when you already have access to the repository.
