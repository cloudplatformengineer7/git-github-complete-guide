### Why .gitignore is useful?

.gitignore is a special file used to tell Git which files or folders should NOT be tracked.
It prevents unnecessary, sensitive, or generated files from being committed to the repository.

📌 Commonly used to ignore:
Secrets
Build artifacts
Logs
OS-specific files

⚠️ Important Rule (Very Common Mistake)

.gitignore works ONLY for untracked files
If a file is already committed:
git rm --cached file-name
Then commit again.
